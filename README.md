# Bank_app
CRUD functionality for Bank application.


I have used nodeJS for backend services and express for middleware connectivity and Angular 2 for UI. I have also used mongoose for schema design and connectivity to mongodb. Server.js is the starting point for the application and all the api.js has the database service calls and backend functionality. I have maintained the session management through Angulat 2 JWT token and handled the routing through authguard. I have used fixer.io npm for currency conversion. I have created separate components for each functionality like authentication,bank account creation,transfer funds, add/remove beneficiary and statement.

I had created 2 collections in mongodb to store the bank account and user creation and set of transactions. Models folder has the schema details in Mongoose.
